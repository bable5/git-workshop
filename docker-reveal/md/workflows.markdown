## Rebasing Before Merging

* Always do work on a feature branch.
* Make it is messy as you want.
* Use an interactive rebase to put it on top master before merging.

## Telling a story

* Commits don't have to be ordered by time
* Rebasing allows you to checkpoint all work and then put it back together
  in an order that makes logical sense.

## Multiple remotes

* There's nothing special about any remote!

<ul>
<li> Can have as many as you want</li>
<li> Can be anywhere. Local directory, remote server </li>
</ul>
